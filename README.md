# Schlumberger Internship Project

This project was a result of the Schlumberger Field Engineer Internship for summer 2017.

The program was written using VBA.

The program has the following capabilities:

- Keeps track of amount and cost of supplies sent to field for each convoy
- Allows user to select dates of interest to pull data from
- Allows user to graphically view cost and supply data while specifying dates of interest and convoys
- Predicts the amount of supplies needed given a job's parameters, such as number of workers, stages to complete, days in the field, etc.
- Allows the user to interactively add/delete items from a "grocery list" of supplies
- Gives the user the ability to predict the amount of each explosive needed based on client specifications.
- Allows the user to predict how many explosives should be left given the number of stages completed and the size of explosives used


I made a video that demos the program. It can be found here:

Also here is a quick time-lapse of some of my field work. I rebuild mechanical/electronic tools and created circuits containing explosives:
